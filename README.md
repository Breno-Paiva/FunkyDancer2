Funky Dancer 2 : The Beat Goes On

This is a new iteration on a project I worked on while studying at app academy.  
I'll be aiming at improving the core mechanics of the previous game as well as adding new songs and animations.

Technologies used :

Webpack is used for compiling the javascript modules used in this game. Not using webpack can be an issue because modules are loaded synchronously. We will run into issues if a module is loaded and it depends on another module which has still not loaded.
